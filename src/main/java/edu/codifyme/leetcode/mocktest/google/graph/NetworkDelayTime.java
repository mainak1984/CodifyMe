/**
 * 743. Network Delay Time
 * MEDIUM: https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/
 *
 * There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.
 *
 * Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the
 * target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.
 * Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is
 * impossible, return -1.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], N = 4, K = 2
 * Output: 2
 *
 * Note:
 * N will be in the range [1, 100].
 * K will be in the range [1, N].
 * The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
 * All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1 <= u, v <= N and 0 <= w <= 100.
 *
 * Approach 1: DFS
 * Let's record the time dist[node] when the signal reaches the node. If some signal arrived earlier, we don't need to broadcast it anymore. Otherwise, we should broadcast the signal.
 *
 * Algorithm
 * We'll maintain dist[node], the earliest that we arrived at each node. When visiting a node while elapsed time has
 * elapsed, if this is the currently-fastest signal at this node, let's broadcast signals from this node.
 * To speed things up, at each visited node we'll consider signals exiting the node that are faster first, by sorting
 * the edges.
 *
 * Complexity Analysis
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N^N + E log E) where EE is the length of times. We can only fully visit each node up to N-1 times,
 * one per each other node. Plus, we have to explore every edge and sort them. Sorting each small bucket of outgoing
 * edges is bounded by sorting all of them, because of repeated use of the inequality xlogx + ylogy â‰¤(x+y)log(x+y).
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(N + E), the size of the graph O(E), plus the size of the implicit call stack in our DFS O(N).
 *
 * Approach 2: Dijikstra
 * Intuition and Algorithm
 * We use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from our source to all targets. This is a textbook algorithm,
 * refer to this link for more details.
 * Dijkstra's algorithm is based on repeatedly making the candidate move that has the least distance travelled.
