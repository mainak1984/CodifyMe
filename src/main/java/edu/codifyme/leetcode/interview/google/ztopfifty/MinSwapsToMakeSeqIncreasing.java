/**
 * 801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing
 * MEDIUM: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-make-sequences-increasing/
 *
 * We have two integer sequences A and B of the same non-zero length.
 * We are allowed to swap elements A[i] and B[i].  Note that both elements are in the same index position in their
 * respective sequences.
 * At the end of some number of swaps, A and B are both strictly increasing.  (A sequence is strictly increasing if and
 * only if A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1].)
 * Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.  It is guaranteed that
 * the given input always makes it possible.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * Swap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:
 * A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]
 * which are both strictly increasing.
 *
 * Note:
 * A, B are arrays with the same length, and that length will be in the range [1, 1000].
 * A[i], B[i] are integer values in the range [0, 2000].
 *
 *
 * Approach #1: Dynamic Programming
 * Intuition
 * The cost of making both sequences increasing up to the first i columns can be expressed in terms of the cost of
 * making both sequences increasing up to the first i-1 columns. This is because the only thing that matters to the ith
 * column is whether the previous column was swapped or not. This makes dynamic programming an ideal choice.
 *
 * Let's remember n1 (natural1), the cost of making the first i-1 columns increasing and not swapping the i-1th column;
 * and s1 (swapped1), the cost of making the first i-1 columns increasing and swapping the i-1th column.
 *
 * Now we want candidates n2 (and s2), the costs of making the first i columns increasing if we do not swap (or swap,
 * respectively) the ith column.
 *
 * Algorithm
 * For convenience, say a1 = A[i-1], b1 = B[i-1] and a2 = A[i], b2 = B[i].
 * Now, if a1 < a2 and b1 < b2, then it is allowed to have both of these columns natural (unswapped), or both of these
 * columns swapped. This possibility leads to n2 = min(n2, n1) and s2 = min(s2, s1 + 1).
 *
 * Another, (not exclusive) possibility is that a1 < b2 and b1 < a2. This means that it is allowed to have exactly one
 * of these columns swapped. This possibility leads to n2 = min(n2, s1) or s2 = min(s2, n1 + 1).
 *
 * Note that it is important to use two if statements separately, because both of the above possibilities might be
 * possible.
 *
 * At the end, the optimal solution must leave the last column either natural or swapped, so we take the minimum number
 * of swaps between the two possibilities.
