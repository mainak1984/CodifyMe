 * 1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60
 * MEDIUM: https://leetcode.com/problems/pairs-of-songs-with-total-durations-divisible-by-60/
 *
 * You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.
 *
 * Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want
 * the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
 * (time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
 * (time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
 * (time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: time = [60,60,60]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= time.length <= 6 * 104
 * 1 <= time[i] <= 500
 *
 * Approach: Hashmap
 * We would iterate through the input array time and for each element a, we want to know the number of elements b such
 * that:
 *  - b % 60=0, if a % 60=0
 *  - b % 60=60âˆ’a % 60, if a % 60 != 0
 * We can use Approach 1 to implement this logic by repeatedly examining the rest of time again and again for each
 * element a. However, we are able to improve the time complexity by consuming more space - we can store the frequencies
 * of the remainder a % 60, so that we can find the number of the complements in O(1) time.
 * We would initiate an array remainders with size 60 to record the frequencies of each remainder - as the range of
 * remainders is [0,59]. Then we can loop through the array once and for each element a we would:
 *  - if a a % 60=0, add remainders[0] to the result; else, add remainders[60 - t % 60] to the result;
 *  - update remainders[a % 60].
