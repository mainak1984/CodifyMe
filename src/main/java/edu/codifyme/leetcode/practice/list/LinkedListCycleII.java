/**
 * 142. Linked List Cycle II
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/
 *
 * Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
 *
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously
 * following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is
 * connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
 *
 * Notice that you should not modify the linked list.
 *
 * Follow up:
 *
 * Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 * Output: tail connects to node index 1
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
 * Output: tail connects to node index 0
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [1], pos = -1
 * Output: no cycle
 * Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
 * -105 <= Node.val <= 105
 * pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
